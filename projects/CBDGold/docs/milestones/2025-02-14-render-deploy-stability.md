# Milestone: Render Deploy Stability

## Overview
This milestone captures the work completed to unblock and harden the Render deployment pipeline for the CBDGold frontend. The focus was ensuring all native dependencies resolve reliably within Renderâ€™s Linux x64 environment so that `npm run build` succeeds without manual intervention.

## Key Changes
- Added explicit x64 GNU variants of Rollup, LightningCSS, and Tailwind CSS oxide as optional dependencies in `package.json`.
- Updated the Render blueprint so the frontend build script installs the LightningCSS and Tailwind CSS oxide binaries before invoking Vite.
- Standardized the build script to set `ROLLUP_SKIP_NODEJS_NATIVE=1`, preventing optional Rollup modules from crashing during bundling.

## Validation
- Repeated local builds (`SKIP_CLIENT_GEN=1 npm run build`) complete successfully with the updated dependency strategy.
- Git history (commit `84909fd`) records the configuration that produces a clean Render build.

## Next Steps
- Monitor upcoming Render deployments to confirm optional dependency installs continue to succeed.
- If native module versions change, update the explicit install commands and optional dependency entries together.
